Description: The test statistics T_1 and T_1A are developed for testing the pattern of a covariance matrix with a special Toeplitz structure. Then the test statistics T_2 and T_2A are proposed for testing the homogeneity of mean treatment effects in a one-way ANOVA with that special Toeplitz error structure. This package contains two functions: T_1_T_1_A and T_2_T_2_A. The first function is designed to obtain the observed, critical and P-values of the tests T_1 and T_1A for a given data set. The second function gives the observed, critical and P-values of the tests T_2 and T_2A for a given data set. Examples of how these functions work are given in the Help Pages of the package.
